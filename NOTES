I thought about reading docx files and pdfs, but you need special libraries for reading those.
I decided to keep it to simple text files and csv's just for this exercise.

I started with a test case that drove out the DirectoryFileReaderService.class.
I felt once i could read the files and prove it, the rest is easy.

I'm not sure if it was the content of the file that should be returned or the path
to it. so i'll attempt to create an api for listing the files found and
returning the content.

I thought about using Files.isReadable to check the path before trying to walk it,
but I think its better we try to walk and throw an exception so we know for sure
we have a bad path

we need to consider the size of the files. we may be searching a file that too large
and fail trying to retrieve its content
